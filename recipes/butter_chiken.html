        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground Kashmiri Lal Mirch</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon Kasuri Methi</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>method</h4>
    <h4>Marinate the chiken</h4>
    <p>Bring the chicken and the rest of the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. Using your hands, massage the marinade into the chicken.
       Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight.</p>
    <h4>Saok cashews and almonds</h4>
    <p>Soak cashews and almonds in water for at least an hour to (or up to overnight)
         before preparing the rest of the recipe.</p>
    <h4>cook the chiken </h4>
    <p>Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil to the pan.
         Working in batches, remove chicken from the marinade and grill them on the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, 
        until the chicken is cooked through (clear juice runs out of it when you cut into it). Do not crowd the pan.</p>
    <h4>Start making the sauce:</h4>
    <p>Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven or a skillet on medium low heat. As soon as the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste followed by sugar. 
        Saut√© for 1 to 2 minutes.
         Stir in the tomato and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on medium high heat, until all the extra liquid is cooked off. The sauce should be a loose, paste-like consistency.
         Add coriander, garam masala, Kashmiri Lal Mirch, and salt. Stir and cook on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat.</p>
    <h4>Puree the sauce with the nuts:</h4>
    <p>Transfer the paste to a blender or the bowl of a food processor.
         Add the soaked cashews and almonds. Blend into a smooth paste.</p>
    <h4>Finish the dish</h4>
    <p>Finish the dish:
        Return the paste to the cooking pan over medium heat. Add the water to the paste and stir to make a smooth sauce.
         As the sauce begins to boil, add the grilled chicken and heavy cream. Stir well. Cover the pan and simmer for 5 minutes.</p>
    <h4>Rest the butter chicken:</h4>
    <p>Turn off the heat and uncover the pan. Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and the kasuri methi. Cover again, 
        and let the dish rest for 8 to 10 minutes so the flavor of kasuri methi can marry into the butter chicken.</p>
    <h4>Serve the chiken</h4>
    <p>Serve the butter with a side of steamed basmati rice, roti, or naan. Leftovers will keep refrigerated, covered, for five days.

        You can freeze this dish in an airtight covered container or a zip-top bag for a month.
         Thaw and reheat in a saucepan over medium-low heat to retain the texture.</p>
